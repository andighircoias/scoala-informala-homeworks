You need to design an application that allows the possibility to calculate the surface and perimeter for multiple types
of shape: rectangle, square, circle and triangle.
The tool should allow the possibility to add multiple shapes and calculate the total sum for perimeter and for surface.

Also, the application should make sure that 2 similar shapes couldnâ€™t be added to the drawing tool. In case 2 similar
shapes are added, an appropriate message should be printed to console.

Since you want to be sure that you provide a high quality implementation, simulations are needed to prove the main
functionalities described above, work correctly (add all types of shapes, add duplicates, add single shape and pairs
of shapes). JUNIT tests should be provided for this scope.

To deliver the work, just create a pull request on git where you have committed the solution.
